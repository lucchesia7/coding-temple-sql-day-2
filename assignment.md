# Entity Relationship Diagrams Assignment

Using lucidchart, create an ERD for a movie theater (customers, tickets, concessions, movies at minimum but you can have more). Inside of your ERD please backup the reasoning behind why you decided to use the relationships you chose. You can do so by adding text to the bottom of the ERD.

Once your ERD is created, create a new database in pgAdmin 4 and create the tables using the queries we learned today. You must then insert at least 2 rows of data into each table that you create.

NOTE: For an added challenge, feel free to also play around with changing/altering the database tables.

In total for this homework assignment, you should have 2 or 3 files inside of your GitHub repo:
- ERD as a PDF
- SQL file for creating tables
- SQL file for inserting data into tables (can be combined with above sql file if clearly labeled)

Once done, commit files to GitHub and submit the link to the assignment
